## Introduction

This webpage and associated repository is meant to serve as a curated portal to the many valuable people and resources you will work with as a member of the CPHG community. We want you to be happy and productive during your time with us, so we developed this repository as a tool to make your computational problems at CPHG easier to solve. Please feel free to submit issues to this site and contribute to the resources listed here. Welcome to CPHG!

## UVA Computation and Data Resource Exchange (CADRE)

[CADRE][cadre] is a University-wide exchange designed to simplify the process of finding local research technology solutions. The [CADRE][cadre] website provides a comprehensive list of the software, services, training opportunities, storage solutions, and computational hardware available to UVA scholars. [CADRE][cadre] is multi-disciplinary and supports all eleven schools of the University.

## Databio Bioinformatics Skills Resources

Nathan Sheffield curates a [list](http://databio.org/skills/) of resources to help students interested in developing foundational skills useful for computational biology.

## CPHG IT Infrastructure

* We may need to put this behind a firewall and require NetBadge login
  * I haven't learned how to do that yet
  * Notwithstanding the firewall issue, this may be the most valuable resource in this list
  * Here is my first attempt at putting server information behind a firewall: [a collab site](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/a412f617-1d58-4aa2-a58a-1cd7f37b93dc/page/02d2821c-67f4-456f-ada7-023e878d92d5)
