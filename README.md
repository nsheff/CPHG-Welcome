## Introduction

Welcome to the CPHG Computation Group! This webpage and associated repository is meant to serve as a community-curated portal to the many valuable people and resources you will work with as a member of the CPHG computational community. Please feel free to submit issues to this site and contribute to the resources listed here. Welcome to CPHG Computing!

## UVa Computation and Data Resource Exchange (CADRE)

* [CADRE][cadre] is a University-wide exchange designed to simplify the process of finding local research technology solutions. The [CADRE][cadre] website provides a comprehensive list of the software, services, training opportunities, storage solutions, and computational hardware available to UVa scholars.


## UVa Advanced Research Computing

* ARCS [homepage](https://arcs.virginia.edu/)

* Rivanna [homepage](https://arcs.virginia.edu/rivanna)
  * *Rivanna is UVa's High-Performance Computing (HPC) system. Rivanna is open to all faculty, research staff, and graduate students of the University.*

* Rivanna status [page](https://arcs.virginia.edu/rivanna-status-update)

## UVa School of Medicine Research Computing

* SOMRC [homepage](https://somrc.virginia.edu/)

* Ivy [homepage](https://somrc.virginia.edu/userinfo/ivy/)
  * *Ivy is a secure computing environment for researchers working with sensitive data. The environment meets HIPAA requirements. Access to Ivy resources is project-based, limited to PIs and their designees, and requires approval. HPC services will be coming soon to the Ivy environment.*

* SOMRC globus [page](https://somrc.virginia.edu/userinfo/globus/)


## Databio Bioinformatics Skills Resources

* Nathan [Sheffield][sheffield] curates a [list](http://databio.org/skills/) of resources to help students interested in developing foundational skills useful for computational biology on his [website](http://databio.org/).


## Command Line Tools

* Utilities for MacOS
  * [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)

* Unix/Linux Tutorials
  * ARCS unix [tutorial](https://arcs.virginia.edu/UNIX-tutorials-for-beginners)

* Karl Broman's minimal github [tutorial](https://github.com/kbroman/github_tutorial)

* Nathan Sheffield's [conceptual introduction][github] to github


## CPHG IT Infrastructure

* We may need to put this behind a firewall and require NetBadge login
  * I haven't learned the best way to do that yet
  * Here is my first attempt at putting server information behind a firewall: [a collab site](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/a412f617-1d58-4aa2-a58a-1cd7f37b93dc/page/02d2821c-67f4-456f-ada7-023e878d92d5)
